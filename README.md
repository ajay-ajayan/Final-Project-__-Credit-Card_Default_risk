Credit-card-Default-Risk-Capstone-Project-Ajay A L



This project addresses the business problem of predicting whether a credit card client will default on their payment next month. Accurate prediction of such defaults helps financial institutions reduce risk and make informed decisions about credit allocation.

Using historical customer data, various machine learning models are trained and evaluated to classify customers as high-risk or low-risk.
